 * It would be a shame if you had to keep writing the same code over and over again, wouldn't it? 
 * I mean, it was *fun to write, 
 * but it would slowly wear away at you. 
 * Let's imagine that you have the following function.
 
 *   function welcome($name) {
 *     return "Welcome, {$name}!";
 *   }
 * 
 *  We can resuse this function by including it in other files
 * see the welcome.php file and program.php file
 *
